INTRODUCTION   \\nDocumentation is a record of the care, the clinical assessment, professional  judgment and critical \\nthinking used by a health professional in relation to theprovision of patient care. This documentation may \\ninclude written and electronichealth records, obse rvation charts, actions, outcomes, check lists, \\ncommunicationbooks, shift  / management reports and clinical anecdotal notes or personal reflections  (held by \\nthe clinicians personally or any other form of documentation pertaining tothe care provided. The me dical \\ndocumentation (medical record or paper basedrecord) therefore, is one of the health (clinical) records in which ', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\IJAAS-SCOPUS.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n Document(page_content='      \\uf072          ISSN : 2252 -8814  \\nIJAAS   Vol. 5, No. 4,  December  2016 :  157 – 162 158 \\nwe need to assessits practice level or status. Of course, the practice or the documentation may berecorded or \\ndone by doctors, nurses, mid wives and other care providers (health professionals) in general  [1]. \\nDespite widespread interest in standardizing of health records in many parts of theworld  [2], narrative \\ntext record (manually written documentation) for patient’sinformation is a usual t rend everywhere. The data in \\ndocumentation can beorganized in a variety of ways including time -oriented, problem -oriented, and \\nsourceoriented  approaches. Based on a recent review, an emphasis of data attributes  (accuracy, completeness, \\nand timeliness) are needed for documentation to quality  measurement  [3]. \\nLikewise the value of health records is ultimately dependent on their completeness  for providing \\npatient’s information and care provision. This varies with physician topatient communication, the patient’ s \\ncondition and the physician’s documentation  style. Of course, clinical documentation (record) has been found \\ncomplete andappropriate for clinical decisio ns when data are filled on time [4] . But, study shows that many \\nphysicians and other health care prov iders have argued  that the quality for clinical documentation is inadequate \\nand overloading withirrelevant data  [5]. \\nPaper -based documentation is practiced in most developing countries  [6]; as an  African it is a basic \\nissue to assess this documentation pra ctice of health  professionals and related factors towards documentation. \\nDeveloping counties  therefore are, highly relied on standard tools, clinical guidelines, documentation  books \\nforms  / formats, procedures and other resources  / materials to record pati ent’s  information in hospitals and \\nother health centers due to a very limited health  professionals’ practice unlike the developed world (i.e. EHR)  \\n[6]. The information in the medical documentation is definitely valuable. However, theprocess of documenting \\nit is given less priority by many health care givers. A busy  physician may accidentally record a progress note \\nin the wrong patient’s health  records. Medical or clinical assessment of vital signs might be consistent, but the  \\ndocumentation process was highl y variable within groups and among hospitals.  Different health care \\nprofessionals and specialties have developed their own typesof documentation style to document patient’s care \\nin the paper -based patient record  system. Lack of a unified documentation appr oach finally leads to a national  \\nproposal to generate a unified paper -based patient record. This serves as a goodbasis for a unified national \\ndocumentation style. Since, transforming the paperbased  record into digital form by purely digitizing the \\nnarrative text does not yield the  benefits. So, it is essential that the structure, data set headings and \\nclassifications  are used as clear medical  / clinical do cumentation guides and contents [7] . A nurse may get a \\ncall to assist a patient and forget to r ecord med ication given toanother patient [8] . \\nAlthough clinical guidelines and standardized tools are essential for evidence based  decision making \\nhealthcare provision and manually written documentation practice;their usability used by health professionals  \\nis low because of physician’s attitude [9] . Evidence indicates that besides of their benefits for documentation \\npractice,  guidelines, documentation sheets/formats, standard tools in total were in doubt ofresistance from \\nhealth professionals. Information r etrieval from narrative documentsof chart or written documentation is rarely \\nused outside laboratories where  information extraction systems have been developed  [10]. From all the above \\nreviews, medical documentations (manually written documents)  are the on ly warehouse of patient’s \\ninformation. But, these documentations are withmany problems and sometimes negligible for some health \\nprofessionals. This is dueto variations of documentation styles and documentation standards, \\nsheets/formatsthey used. On the oth er hand, data in hospitals remain incomplete and inappropriatewhile \\ndocumenting, reporting, charting and etc. And thus, most records neglect thepatients’ problem and practices \\nregarding documentation i n the hospital being  experienced [11].  \\nThere are gaps i n Ethiopian context. Because, there is no study conducted to inform  whether the above \\nmentioned standard tools are properly used to the completenessof documentation or not. Since Ethiopia is one \\nof the developing nations, theproblem regarding patient’s wri tten record or documented information is a \\nseriousissue from different corners.  However, the level of documentation practice of health professionals, \\nattitude  stowards documentation about patient’s information and even other related factors  affecting \\ndocum entation practice are not known indeed. Only, the federal ministry of  health (FMoH) was trying to \\nalleviate such problems by giving training for healthworkers and preparing guidelines like Ethiopian hospitals \\nreform implementation  guideline. But, no resear ches were done to show where the status of documentation  \\npractices and the gaps are nationally. So, it is better to focus on reducing the gaps  between practice level of \\nprofessionals and their attitude to documentation using  evidence. On the other hand whe n to document, what \\nto document, ho  w todocument etc are crucial aspects to fill the gaps.  \\n \\n \\n2. EXISTING METHODS  \\nMedical Documentation Practice  Since 2006, AMIA has organized Health Policy to examine issues \\nconcerninghealthcare and health information policy towards the generation of health records  (medical \\ndocumentations) that will give up the rich patients’ data. This is an evidence  in which medical documentations \\nplay a key role in the efforts by providing access todata that can improve individual care, org anization support, ', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\IJAAS-SCOPUS.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n Document(page_content='IJAAS  ISSN: 2252 -8814  \\uf072 \\n \\nMedical Documentation Practice of Health Professionals and Attitude…  (Adinew Belay ) 159 \\nclinical research, qualityimprovement efforts and the achievement of public health objectives; all of whichwork \\ntowards documentation system improvement(12).  Study shows that health professionals have a positive \\nperspective about  documentation systems, but their ‘full function’ practice is low: 3.6% in 2006 to 6.9%   \\nin 2009  [12,13]. \\nMedical record keeping has been almost fully implemented even in several  developed countries \\nincluding Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and UK although it has been implemented in less than 20% of \\nUS hospitals. Likewise, paper -based  documentation is practiced in most developing countries  [6]. Nurses in \\nthe Netherlands recorded low scores on the accuracy of the  documentation of their interventions  [14]. The \\nstudy conducted in Jamaican based on descriptive cross sectional design, 2013  by reviewed 90 patients records \\nof 3 wards were audited documentation practices  health professionals using Jamaican Ministry of Health tool. \\nThe result shows (97%,  98%, 96% and 98%) percentages of records were legible, neat, and concise and  \\nfollowed documentation guidelines respectively. Only 26% of the records hadnursing diagnosis, which \\ncorresponded to the current medical diagnosis and 48%had documented  evidence of discharge pl anning [15] . \\nIn Finland, paper -based patient records have been a longitudinal (continuin g)collection of patient data [7]. \\nDocumentation of patients with chronic pain from the Southern health care centerregion of Stockholm results \\nthat nurses reported insuf ficient documentation (24%).  In Nigeria, health record Inadequacies were found in \\nclinical documentation,especially gross under  utilization of discharge summary forms. However, some \\nformswere properly documented, suggesting that hospital health care provid ers possess . The necessary skills \\nfor quality clinical documentation but lack the will. When  dictation or a manual system is used, the production \\nof accurate health records  depends on the provider s’ record keeping practices [16]. Results from 9 general \\nhospitals of South Africa report among 459 records in 1989,  27.7% (127) of the records were from medical \\nunits, 29.4% from surgical units,14.6 from pediatrics units and the remaining from the general units; it shows  \\ninsufficient and poorly documented practice  [17]. \\n \\n \\n3. METHODOLOGY  \\n3.1. Study Design  \\nAn institution based cross sectional quantitative study was conducted in University of  Gondar hospital \\nfrom March 15 to April 30 2016.  The study was conducted at University of Gondar Hospital, North Gondar,  \\nNorth West Ethiopia. The hospital was established in 1920 in Amhararegional state in North Gondar zone, \\nNorth West Ethiopia, Gondar town  administration 748 far from Addis Ababa. In 2016, the total number of \\nhealth  professionals in this hospital is about 793 who provide services for the  catchment area with estimated \\nnumber of populations more than five million.  All health professionals who were worked at the University of \\nGondar  Hospital during data collection period.  \\n \\n3.2. The Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  \\nAll health professionals who were not willing, those who were on leave and  those pharmacists were \\nexcluded.Sample size in this study was calculated as follows using the assumptions of single  population \\nproportion formula by the assumptions of.  \\nn= sample size  \\nz= standardized normal distribution value at 95% CI, which is 1.96  \\np= medical documentation practice 50%  \\nd=w= the margin error, taken as 5%  \\nn= [Z (α/2)2 * P (1 -P)]/d2  \\nn= [(1.96)2 * 0.5(1 - 0.5)]/(0.05)2  \\nn= 384  \\nHere correction factor was used (population reduction formula)  \\nn/(1+n/N)=384/(1+384/629)  \\n= 240  \\nBy assuming t he non -response rate of 10% [18]  the total sample size became 264.  \\n \\n3.3. Sampling Selection Procedure  \\nStratified sampling procedure was used to select the respondents. Health  professionals in  each ward \\nof inpatient department were randomly selected usingsimple random sampling after proportional allocation of \\nhealth professionals in eachprofession and work setting was ensured.

Even though the finding is too hard for \\ncomparing with other local studies, let tocom pare with countries having different socio -economic status, \\ngeographical  settings, life style and others.  As it was mentioned, this study revealed that good medical \\ndocumentation practice  among health professionals was 45.4%; and this is much lower as comp ared tostudy in \\nJamaica (98 %) [19] . The difference of course could be due to the research  methodology, research setting. \\nDescriptive approach was followed and only medicalward were the concern there in Jamaica but, here \\ninstitutional cross sectionalquanti tative approach was followed and four work setting wards were included \\nasthe same time respectively. Another difference could be the way to follow standard  documentation guidelines \\nand procedures. Whereas, the result obtained from thisstudy is higher than the study done in Iran (22.9%) [20] . \\nThe possible reason couldbe due to the different instrument used and the institutional structure that means  \\norganizational supervision system, responsibility and accountability of the leadersand institution.  \\nThe finding s of this study were collectively obtained from 16.9% from medical wards,  16.9% from \\nsurgical ward, 20.3% from pediatrics ward and 45.8% from obstetrics  and gynecology wards. This result is \\nsomewhat closer to results from 9 general  hospitals of South Afric a audit among 459 records in 1989, 27.7% \\nof the records  were from medical units, 29.4% from surgical units, 14.6  from pediatrics units and there  maining \\nfrom the general units. Specially, the result in this study 45.8% from  obstetrics and gynecology wards were \\nsufficient enough than results of all the unitsof South Africa.  The study conducted in Jamaican in 2013 based \\non descriptive cross sectional  design by reviewed 90 patients records were audited documentation practices of  \\nhealth professionals using Jama ican Ministry of Health tool. The result shows 98%  of records were followed \\ndocumentation guidelines and 48% had document  edevidence of discharge planning [15].  But, in this study \\n60.8% of health professionals  had followed medical documentation standard tools (sheet and \\nguideline,procedures). This might be because of the socio -economic and cultural difference  between the two \\ncountries. And the difference of tools used by ministry of health ofthe two countries.  A Postal questionnaire \\nsurvey between October  1993 and January 1994 was  conducted at Hospitals found Oxford region and the result \\nshows that most  respondents 77% were welcoming favorable attitudes towards medical  documentation  \\nstandard tools [21] . This is again higher than this study’s finding. Thisi s most probably due to the difference \\nof study design selected and the ways of lifestyle the participants followed.  This study reveals that was \\nsignificantly associated with medical documentation  practice.  \\nThose professionals who have favorable attitude ab out medical documentation areless likely to have \\ngood documentation practice compared to those who have  unfavorable attitude. This is due to human resource \\nshortages, less organizational  support and shortag e of equipment as described in Figure 4 . This stud y is \\nconsist ent with studies from Malawi [22]  a mixed of quantitative and qualitativemethods was applied using \\nchecklists at the Medical Department of Kamuzu Central  Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi identified that human \\nresource shortages, staff  attitudes and  shortage of equipment as big obstacles for documentation registers.  From \\nthe study carried out in Nigeria in 2009, documentation performance was verygood (98.49%) and hence the \\nresult was much higher than the findings of this study.  Of course, the reason may be a study conducted in \\nNigeria was a retrospective  study design to assess the documentation of 780 paper -based health records \\nofinpatients discharged. But records reviewed from the depar tments of obstetrics  (45.9%) [23]  was consistent \\nwith the study r esult in our research (45.8%).  \\n \\n5.2. Limitations  \\na. Self-administrator questionnaires are not the best way to collect the views ofindividual professionals \\nabout such a subject. We have no audit of therespondent’s attitude and performance in MDP.  \\nb. The study was conducted only on a single referral hospital; and thus it is notgeneralize able for other \\nhealth centers (HC).  \\nc. A broad literature search on this topic shows lack of similar published studiesin Ethiopia. Hence it was \\ndifficult to make comparisons in the  Ethiopian healthprofessionals’ context.  \\n \\n \\n6. CONCLUSION  \\nThe findings of this study indicated that health professionals at hospitals have  somewhat poor \\ndocumentation practice and unfavorable attitude to medical  documentation practice. The study confirms the \\nimportance of work setting,  documenting for all patients using documentation standard tools and attitude  \\ntowards medical documentations. It also shows how universal standard guidelines  for care in different settings \\nare differently used. And even, one can h ave favorable  attitude towards medical documentation, there might \\nlack medical documentation  practice. This study findings lead to conclude that if someone had favorable focus \\ntomedical documentation; it didn’t mean that s/he had put action to medical  docu mentation practice.
